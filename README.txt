Basic inforamtaion about the application- 

Contains two pages
-Index.php -  This has all the front end code for the application which displayes images likes etc.
-Instagram.php - This acts like a contoller of our app that decodes and sanatizes and connects us to the JSON 

Important  instruction  - Please add yor ACCESS TOKEN from instagram under ''  $access_toke"
Please add your instagram user ID which you use to log on to instagram  under "$username"  

--------Features of the webpage---------------
The first thing you see on the page is the user name displayed. 
Then you have the buttons that you can use to allign the images 
Then you have a list of your instagram images with numbe of likes and location of the picture

At last you have the total number of like you have achieved till now!
Then you have the average number of likes that you achieved till now
